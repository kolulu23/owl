# owl
Owl is a DSL that evaluates simple expressions and statements.

Owl uses ANTLR4 to generate parsers.

Here's a diagram of Owl's planned module design:

# TODO
- Dividing precision/scale could be set in function definition: #avg
- list variable can be initialized at declaration time
- Caching parse tree

Owl has nothing to do with the [Web Ontology Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language).
